                At EMC Land nothing is as important than to ensure everyone I do
                business with can and does achieve their goals for land owning.
                My
                name is Christopher Ross and I operate this company with the
                same
                passion for helping others that I did as a cardiac nurse. I can
                assure you that in order to help a person in any manner you must
                first be willing to compromise and communicate to find a mutual
                path
                to achievement.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br>
              </p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"> The reason I
                started this company was to help people reach a goal that I
                myself
                was able to gain through the very practices that I use today to
                help
                others. No matter what your goal is for land owning, I can
                assure
                that EMC Land wants you to see that goal become a reality. I
                will
                personally go to greater lengths that many others in this
                business
                will not do to help those in need. No task or ask of anyone will
                ever deter me from continuing to work to that mutually
                beneficial
                partnership and agreement.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br>
              </p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br>
              </p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"> This business
                like
                so many others allow people to have limitless options for who
                they
                choose to deal with. However, as in all aspects it is the person
                you
                do business with that you must be able to trust. I am grateful
                for
                my nursing career allowing me to develop that caring ability to
                understand how important that trust is. </p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br>

              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br>
              </p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"> I look forward
                to
                you giving me the opportunity to help in any way I can. </p>
